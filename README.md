# HTML5 File Storage Layout
This is a generic recreation of MediaFire for an assignment about website basics. There is a preview available through GitHub Pages. I intend to make this less sloppy later, this is more of a proof of concept than anything. I used Claude Sonnet to create this, though I'll definitely review it more thoroughly later as is needed. Feel free to leave comments as to how to make this suck less, even though I don't have any big plans for this other than just to have it be done for the most part.
